## Task 1. Add a new user

Step 1: Add the new user to the system: sudo useradd researcher9

This creates a new user account named researcher9.

Step 2: Set research_team as the user's primary group: sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9

## Task 2: Assign file ownership and make researcher9 the owner of the project_r.txt file, use the chown command.


sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt

sudo: Runs the command with elevated privileges.

chown researcher9: Changes the user ownership of the file to researcher9.

/home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt: Path to the file that needs ownership reassigned.

After running the command, you can verify the change with:

ls -l /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
The output should now show researcher9 as the file's owner instead of researcher2.

## Task 3: Add the user to a secondary group, and keep their primary group as research_team while adding them to the secondary group sales_team, use the usermod command with the -a and -G options.

Command: sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9

sudo: Runs the command with elevated privileges.

usermod: Modifies the existing user account.

-a: Appends the user to the new group without removing them from existing ones (must be used with -G).

-G sales_team: Specifies the secondary group to add.

researcher9: The username of the account you're modifying.

## Task 4: Delete a User and Clean Up the Group
This task involved safely removing the user researcher9 from the system after they left the organization. Below are the steps taken to complete this process.

### Deleted the user from the system, the following command was executed:
sudo userdel researcher9

This removed the user account researcher9, but did not remove the automatically created group with the same name. The expected message appeared:
userdel: group researcher9 not removed because it is not the primary group of user researcher9.

### Removed the user’s group
To clean up and avoid leaving unused groups in the system, the following command was used:

sudo groupdel researcher9
This removed the researcher9 group that remained after deleting the user.

### (Optional – Not used in this case)

If it had been necessary to remove the user and their home directory together, the following command could have been used:

sudo userdel -r researcher9
This command would have deleted the user and also permanently removed all files in their home directory.

### Verification (if needed)

To confirm the user and group were deleted:


getent passwd researcher9
getent group researcher9
These commands return no output if the user and group no longer exist.

This process ensures that both user and group records are cleanly removed from the system, which is a best practice in user account lifecycle management.
